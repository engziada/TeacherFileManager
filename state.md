Current State Analysis
✅ Successfully Implemented
    Database Migration: Successfully moved from PostgreSQL to SQLite (as per memory and enhancements.md)
    Google Drive Integration: OAuth flow implemented with proper teacher-specific authentication
    File Storage Structure: Central index + public view links model implemented
    Arabic Localization: Full RTL support with Arabic UI
    Multi-role System: Teachers, parents, and school admin access
    Progressive Enhancement: Service account deprecated in favor of OAuth

⚠️ Critical Issues Identified
        Security Vulnerabilities
            Google Drive service account keys still referenced in code structure
            No rate limiting on API endpoints
            Missing input validation on several routes
        Data Consistency Issues
            File path structure doesn't fully match enhancements.md requirements
            Missing academic year in folder structure
            Student folder naming inconsistent with suggested format
        Performance Concerns
            No pagination on large queries
            Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
            No caching mechanism for repeated requests

Recommended Immediate Enhancements
    1. Implement Structured Folder Path
    typescript
    // New folder structure: 2025/الصف-السادس/الفصل-2/1234567890-أحمد-علي/اختبارات/
    const pathParts = [
    academicYear,           // "2024-2025"
    `الصف-${grade}`,        // "الصف-السادس"
    `الفصل-${classNumber}`, // "الفصل-2"
    `${civilId}-${name}`,   // "1234567890-أحمد-علي"
    category                // "اختبارات"
    ];
    2. Enhanced Security Implementation
    Environment Variables Audit: Create .env.example with all required variables
    Rate Limiting: Implement express-rate-limit for API endpoints
    Input Sanitization: Add comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
    Secure File Upload: Implement file type validation and virus scanning
    3. Performance Optimization
    typescript
    // Add database indexes for common queries
    CREATE INDEX idx_files_academic_year ON files(academic_year);
    CREATE INDEX idx_files_grade_class ON files(grade, class_number);
    CREATE INDEX idx_files_upload_date_desc ON files(upload_date DESC);
    4. Enhanced Error Handling
    Arabic Error Messages: Consistent Arabic error responses
    Retry Logic: Automatic retry for Google Drive API failures
    Graceful Degradation: Fallback behavior when services are unavailable

Advanced Features Implementation
    1. Smart File Organization
    typescript
    // Auto-categorization based on file content
    const autoCategorize = (filename: string, content?: string): FileCategory => {
    const patterns = {
        [FILE_CATEGORIES.EXAMS]: /(اختبار|امتحان|test|exam)/i,
        [FILE_CATEGORIES.HOMEWORK]: /(واجب|homework|assignment)/i,
        [FILE_CATEGORIES.GRADES]: /(درجات|grades|نتيجة)/i
    };
    // Implementation logic
    };
    2. Progressive Web App Features
    Offline Support: Service worker for offline file viewing
    Push Notifications: Notify parents of new files
    Camera Integration: Direct document scanning with auto-crop
    3. Advanced Analytics Dashboard
    typescript
    interface TeacherInsights {
    totalFiles: number;
    filesByCategory: Record<FileCategory, number>;
    mostActiveStudents: Array<{studentName: string; fileCount: number}>;
    uploadTrend: Array<{date: string; count: number}>;
    missingCategories: FileCategory[];
    }
    4. Bulk Operations Enhancement
    Excel Export: Download student data with file counts
    Bulk Upload: Drag-and-drop multiple files with progress tracking
    Smart Naming: Auto-rename files based on student + category + date

Security & Privacy Enhancements
    1. Data Privacy Compliance
    GDPR Compliance: Right to deletion and data portability
    PII Masking: Civil IDs masked in UI (show only last 4 digits)
    Access Logs: Track who accessed what files when
    2. Enhanced Authentication
    Two-Factor Authentication: SMS/Email verification for teachers
    Session Management: Secure session handling with refresh tokens
    Audit Trail: Complete logging of all file operations

Immediate Action Items
    Create missing database indexes (30 min)
    Implement structured folder naming (2 hours)
    Add comprehensive input validation (1 hour)
    Create environment variables documentation (30 min)
    Implement rate limiting (45 minutes)
